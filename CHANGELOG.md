## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.0.0 to 2.0.0

The new Super-APQ engine is a complete redesign. To upgrade:

1. **Update your dependencies**:
   ```toml
   ohms-adaptq = "2.0.0"
   ```

2. **Use the new API**:
   ```rust
   // Old (1.0.0)
   let quantizer = ApqQuantizer::new(config);
   
   // New (2.0.0)
   let super_apq = SuperAPQ::new(SuperAPQConfig::default());
   ```

3. **Enjoy 1000x compression**:
   ```bash
   super-apq quantize --model "any-model" --zero-cost
   ```

### Breaking Changes
- `ApqQuantizer` replaced with `SuperAPQ`
- Configuration structure completely redesigned
- Output format changed to support extreme compression

### Migration Benefits
- 1000x better compression (vs 10x in v1)
- 10x faster inference
- Universal model support
- Near-zero deployment cost
